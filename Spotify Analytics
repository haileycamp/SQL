# In this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# I then created a table to insert the Spotify data into. 
# Lastly, I analyzed the data using SQL.

# Creating the table:
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL )

# Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table. 

# Next, I analyzed the data using several SQL queries. 

# 1. Who are the top 10 artists by popularity?
SELECT popularity, artist_name 
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10

# 2. What artist released the longest song?
SELECT artist_name, track_name, duration_ms
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY duration_ms DESC
LIMIT 1

# 3. What is the average loudness by artist and track?
SELECT artist_name, track_name, AVG(loudness) 
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name

# 4. What is the average dancability for the 10 most popular songs?
SELECT AVG(danceability), track_name, artist_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY track_name, artist_nameI
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10
