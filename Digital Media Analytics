# In this project, I downloaded a dataset called chinook that represents a digital media store. I then answered questions about the data using SQL queries.

#1. Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. 
SELECT customerid, firstname, lastname, country
FROM chinook.customers 
WHERE country <> 'USA';

#2. Show only customers from Brazil.
SELECT customerid, firstname, lastname, country
FROM chinook.customers 
WHERE country = 'Brazil';

#3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.
SELECT c.firstname, c.lastname, i.invoicedate, i.invoiceid, i.billingcountry
FROM chinook.customers c
JOIN chinook.invoices i
ON c.customerid = i.customerid
WHERE billingcountry = 'Brazil';

#4. Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.
SELECT lastname, firstname, title
FROM chinook.employees 
WHERE title = 'Sales Support Agent';

#5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.
SELECT DISTINCT billingcountry
FROM chinook.invoices;

#6. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.
SELECT i.invoiceid, e.lastname, e.firstname
FROM ((chinook.invoices i
JOIN chinook.customers c
ON i.customerid = c.customerid)
JOIN chinook.employees e
ON c.supportrepid = e.employeeid);

#7. Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.
SELECT c.firstname, c.lastname, c.country, e.firstname, e.lastname, i.total
FROM ((chinook.invoices i
JOIN chinook.customers c
ON i.customerid = c.customerid)
JOIN chinook.employees e
ON c.supportrepid = e.employeeid);

#8. How many invoices were there in 2009?
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM chinook.invoices i
WHERE invoicedate LIKE '%2009%';

#9. What are the total sales for 2009?
SELECT SUM(total)
FROM chinook.invoices 
WHERE invoicedate LIKE '%2009%';

#10. Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT i.invoicelineid, t.name
FROM chinook.invoice_items i
JOIN chinook.tracks t
ON i.trackid = t.trackid;

#11. Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT i.invoicelineid, t.name AS track_name, artists.name AS artist_name
FROM (((chinook.invoice_items i
LEFT JOIN chinook.tracks t
ON i.trackid = t.trackid)
INNER JOIN chinook.albums a
ON t.albumid = a.albumid)
LEFT JOIN chinook.artists
ON a.artistid = artists.artistid);

#12. Provide a query that shows all the tracks, and include the album name, media type, and genre.
SELECT t.name AS track_name, a.title AS album_name, m.name AS media_type, g.name AS genre
FROM (((chinook.tracks t
JOIN chinook.albums a
ON t.albumid = a.Albumid)
JOIN chinook.media_types m
ON t.mediatypeid = m.mediatypeid)
JOIN chinook.genres g
ON t.genreid = g.genreid);

#13. Show the total sales made by each sales agent.
SELECT e.lastname, e.firstname, SUM(i.total) AS total_sales
FROM ((chinook.invoices i
JOIN chinook.customers c
ON i.customerid = c.customerid)
JOIN chinook.employees e
ON c.supportrepid = e.employeeid)
WHERE e.title = 'Sales Support Agent'
GROUP BY e.employeeid;

#14. Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?
SELECT e.lastname, e.firstname, SUM(i.total) AS total_sales
FROM ((chinook.invoices i
JOIN chinook.customers c
ON i.customerid = c.customerid)
JOIN chinook.employees e
ON c.supportrepid = e.employeeid)
WHERE e.title = 'Sales Support Agent'
GROUP BY e.employeeid
ORDER BY total_sales DESC;
