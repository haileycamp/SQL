# In this project, I downloaded a dataset that represents a digital media store. I then answered questions about the data using SQL queries.

#1. Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. 
SELECT customerid, firstname, lastname, country
FROM chinook.customers 
WHERE country <> 'USA';

#2. Show only customers from Brazil.
SELECT customerid, firstname, lastname, country
FROM chinook.customers 
WHERE country = 'Brazil';

#3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.
SELECT c.firstname, c.lastname, i.invoicedate, i.invoiceid, i.billingcountry
FROM chinook.customers c
JOIN chinook.invoices i
ON c.customerid = i.customerid
WHERE billingcountry = 'Brazil';

#4. Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.
SELECT lastname, firstname, title
FROM chinook.employees 
WHERE title = 'Sales Support Agent';

#5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.
SELECT DISTINCT billingcountry
FROM chinook.invoices;

#6. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.
SELECT i.invoiceid, e.lastname, e.firstname
FROM ((chinook.invoices i
JOIN chinook.customers c
ON i.customerid = c.customerid)
JOIN chinook.employees e
ON c.supportrepid = e.employeeid);

#7. Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.
SELECT c.firstname, c.lastname, c.country, e.firstname, e.lastname, i.total
FROM ((chinook.invoices i
JOIN chinook.customers c
ON i.customerid = c.customerid)
JOIN chinook.employees e
ON c.supportrepid = e.employeeid);
