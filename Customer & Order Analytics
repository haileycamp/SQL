# In this SQL, I am querying a database with several tables in it to quantify statistics about order and customer data.

#1. How many orders where placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(orderID) FROM BIT_DB.jansales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6

#2. How many of those orders where for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM BIT_DB.jansales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND Product = 'iPhone'

#3. Select the cusomter account numbers for all the orders that where placed in February.
SELECT acctnum FROM BIT_DB.customers
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.febsales 
ON customers.order_id=febsales.orderID
WHERE length(orderID) = 6

#4. Which product was the cheapest sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT distinct product, min(price) FROM BIT_DB.jansales
GROUP BY product

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT product, SUM(quantity)*price AS total_revenue FROM BIT_DB.jansales
GROUP BY product

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT product, SUM(quantity)*price AS total_revenue, location FROM BIT_DB.febsales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT COUNT(distinct cust.acctnum), avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.Febsales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON Feb.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.quantity > 2
AND LENGTH(orderid) = 6

#8. List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many were sold.
